# Cornelia's Temporal Sandbox

This is just a sandbox in which I can explore various things in a minimalistic env. Nothing really to see here but saving history so that I personally may go back and recall earlier experiments. Presumably, the things I've learned here in the sandbox made their way into more durable (pun intended! ;-) projects.
